# Type I and type II leptogenesis

In my Master's degree in Physics at the Federal University of ABC, I studied a puzzling open problem: the asymmtery between matter and antimatter
observed in our Universe. Mechanisms that generate such an asymmetry are called baryogenesis and they can be desbrided in several theoretical formalisms, 
two of which generate baryon number violation via lepton number violation in out-of-equilibrium type I and type II seesaw decays.

Here we present the numerical solutions for the flavorless Boltzmann equations for the type I and II and leptogenesis scenarios
